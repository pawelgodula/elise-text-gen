## Environment
Trying to make it work for all LLMs in a single notebook was challenging also because of the dependency hell. For now it is pinned to the one environment version I found to work from [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/paultimothymooney/how-to-use-mistral-from-kaggle-models). 

If you switch to the latest environment you will get the dreaded
`RuntimeError: cutlassF: no kernel found to launch!`
